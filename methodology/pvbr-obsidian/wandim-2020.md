abstract = {This chapter analyzes the role of prosumers in the smart grids as we know them today and as they once might evolve into something more complex in the future. It compares the traditional consumers and the new prosumers and draws some economics and policy implications. Moreover, the chapter explores the linkages between smart grids and future sharing economy development. Last but not the least, it elaborates some relevant policy implications.}
