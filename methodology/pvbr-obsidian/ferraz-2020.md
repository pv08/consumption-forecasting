abstract = {Wind and solar energy have stood out in recent years because of the growth of global installed capacity. This work aims to present wind and solar photovoltaic energy development and its regulatory framework in Brazil, and demonstrate the potential for centralized hybrid generation. Official studies, research reports, and thematic maps were consulted, and two pilot hybrid plants were studied. Results indicate that there is great potential for centralized hybrid generation in the Brazilian Northeast region. However, there is a need for the regulatory framework to evolve to enable its development.}
