Firstly, there is a fixed component of the system load that may be considered as reflecting the business activity of the territory of the company. Secondly, there is a variable component of the load that reflects the effect of the weather. Thirdly, there is a component of load, relatively infrequent in occurrence, that reflects the public response to events of unusual attraction. There is the positive effect on the load of the appeal of radio broadcasts of great local or national interest and the negative effect that evidences the influx of the buying public into shopping areas which reaches its peak in the Christmas period.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/EE.1944.6440647},  ISSN={2376-7804},  month={Dec},}
